<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 36 years old and currently what you call a corporate girlie. My title at my
  current employer is Team Lead. I'm working on developing my skills in order to break
  into the IT field. I know there are many paths you can take, but Front End Development
  is the path I find most interesting. Thanks to Angela Yu, I've taken my first steps
  into transitioning into this skillset.
</p>

<p>During my off time, I enjoy playing video games. Palworld is my current go-to 
  game. I like many city building simulators and survival games. I'm also what you
  call a K-Pop fan. Many concerts have been attended since I've fallen into this new
  hobby. Coachella of last year is one of my more memorable concerts.
</p>

<p>I also have 5 pets! I know that's a lot. There's 3 cats who have claimed my home as
  theirs. Their names are: Talon (a gray tabby); Leo (a white long-hair); and 
  Miwa (an orange tabby). There is also Domino the Chihuahua and Jake the turtle.
