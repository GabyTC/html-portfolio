<h1>The Best Movies According to Gaby</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Summer Wars</h3>
<p>It's a heart warming story about a family coming together to stop
    a crazed virus from unaliving them with a bomb.
</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>It was just a really cool movie where it felt like nothing was happening
    and the visuals were very gorgeous.
</p>
<h3>Armaggedon</h3>
<p>It's just a fun turn your brain off kind of movie. I'm a sucker for 
    disaster movies so this take may be a bit bias.
</p>
<h3>Resident Evil</h3>
<p>It's also just a fun dumb action movie. Who doesn't love Zombies?</p>
